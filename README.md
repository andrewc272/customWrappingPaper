## Research

### Has this been done before?

As far as I can tell there is plenty of custom wrapping paper but I specifically want to be able to customize the look of each side of the gift box. I can't find something like this for gift wrapping paper. Another thing that is adjacent to custom gift wrapping paper is custom boxes with special prints on each side. This is often done for companies and boxes are typically bought in bulk. I would like to try to keep costs of actually using the wrapping paper down. Also I think there is something special about being able to rip into the wrapping paper. That you just wouldn't be able to get with a plain box. This software would be capable of printing on boxes in the future if that is in the intrest of the direction of the project.

### What will make my project stand out amoung others?

I would like to make everything surrounding the custom wrapping paper easy for sharing with others on the platform. I want people to be able to share their designs and be able to make a commision off making a good/funny/quality wrapping paper design. Also I want to make special designs for specific box sizes.

### What is an MVP to work towards?

I would like to first have the ability to edit the box and then view it in 3D.

### If this will be a website what should I write in?
